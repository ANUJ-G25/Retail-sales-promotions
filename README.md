# Retail-sales-promotions
In this project, I utilized Tableau to analyze retail sales data and evaluate the effectiveness of promotions on sales and profit margins. By creating a comprehensive Tableau workbook with multiple worksheets and a dashboard, I visualized key trends and relationships among various variables. I developed a compelling narrative using PowerPoint, incorporating detailed Tableau visuals to present significant insights. The primary focus was on understanding promotional ROI, identifying drivers of promotional performance, and comparing results across different brands and channels. This project highlighted my ability to leverage data visualization tools to generate meaningful insights and effectively communicate them through engaging presentations.
